### ðŸŽ¬ Movie Ranking & ðŸŽ‰ Birthday Invitation Project (HTML Only)

This project is part of my HTML learning journey. It includes two mini web pages:

1. **Movie Ranking Page** â€“ Showcasing my top 3 favorite movies with their genres.  
2. **Birthday Invitation Page** â€“ A fun and creative birthday invite with a cake image and a list of things to bring.

These pages were built using pure HTML â€” without any CSS or JavaScript â€” as practice from my second day of learning web development.

ðŸ“‚ Folder includes:
- `movie-ranking.html`
- `birthday-invite.html`
- `assets/images/CAKE.png`
